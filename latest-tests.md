**Cursor**

Okay, let's proceed with attempting to compile SDL2 from source on your Raspberry Pi, configured specifically for KMS/DRM.

**IMPORTANT PRECAUTIONS:**

1.  **Backup (Optional but Recommended):** If you have anything critical on your Raspberry Pi's SD card that isn't backed up, consider doing so. While these steps are generally reversible, it's always good practice when making system-level library changes.
2.  **SSH Session:** Ensure you have a stable SSH session to your Raspberry Pi.
3.  **Commands are for the Raspberry Pi:** All these commands need to be run on the Raspberry Pi itself, within its terminal.

Here's the plan:

**Phase 1: Preparation and Uninstalling Existing SDL2 Dev Libraries**

You'll run these commands on your Raspberry Pi.

1.  **Update package lists:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2.  **Install essential build tools and SDL2 dependencies:**
    Many of these might already be installed by your `install.sh` script or as dependencies of `libsdl2-dev`, but this ensures they're present. This list is based on common requirements for building SDL2 and its components, and recommendations from Kivy's older docs.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y build-essential git cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
    libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libaudio-dev libjack-dev libsndio-dev \
    libsamplerate0-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev \
    libxfixes-dev libxi-dev libxss-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev \
    libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev \
    libdbus-1-dev libibus-1.0-dev libudev-dev fcitx-libs-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev liblzma-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev libwebp-dev \
    libraspberrypi-dev raspberrypi-kernel-headers xorg-dev
    ```
    *(Note: `xorg-dev` and some X11 libs are included because SDL2's configure script might still check for them even if we disable X11 video drivers; it's safer to have them for the build process itself).*

3.  **Uninstall the existing SDL2 development packages:**
    We do this so that when Kivy (or anything else) compiles against SDL2, it uses our custom-built version. We'll leave the runtime `libsdl2-2.0-0` for now, as uninstalling it might break other things. The build process usually installs its own runtime.
    ```bash
    sudo apt remove libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
    sudo apt autoremove # To clean up any orphaned dependencies
    ```

**Phase 2: Download, Compile, and Install SDL2 and its Satellite Libraries**

We'll compile SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, and SDL2_ttf. It's important to compile these satellite libraries *after* the main SDL2 library is built and installed from source, so they link against your custom SDL2.

Create a temporary directory for the builds:
```bash
mkdir ~/sdl2_build && cd ~/sdl2_build
```

1.  **SDL2 (Main Library)**
    *   Get the latest stable source (check [https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) for the absolute latest, `2.30.3` is current as of this writing, adjust if needed).
        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.30.3/SDL2-2.30.3.tar.gz
        tar -zxvf SDL2-2.30.3.tar.gz
        cd SDL2-2.30.3
        ```
    *   Configure, build, and install:
        We want to enable KMS/DRM and explicitly disable X11 and Wayland video drivers to force it to use the direct framebuffer.
        ```bash
        ./configure --enable-video-kmsdrm --disable-video-x11 --disable-video-wayland --disable-video-rpi --disable-video-opengl 
        make -j$(nproc) # Use all available processor cores
        sudo make install
        cd .. 
        ```
        *(Note: `--disable-video-rpi` is used because that's for the older DispmanX API. `--disable-video-opengl` might seem counterintuitive, but SDL2's KMS/DRM backend typically uses EGL/GLES directly, and we don't want it trying to set up a desktop OpenGL context).*

2.  **SDL2_image**
    *   Get source (e.g., `2.8.2`):
        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases/download/release-2.8.2/SDL2_image-2.8.2.tar.gz
        tar -zxvf SDL2_image-2.8.2.tar.gz
        cd SDL2_image-2.8.2
        ```
    *   Configure, build, install:
        ```bash
        ./configure
        make -j$(nproc)
        sudo make install
        cd ..
        ```

3.  **SDL2_mixer**
    *   Get source (e.g., `2.8.0`):
        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases/download/release-2.8.0/SDL2_mixer-2.8.0.tar.gz
        tar -zxvf SDL2_mixer-2.8.0.tar.gz
        cd SDL2_mixer-2.8.0
        ```
    *   Configure, build, install:
        ```bash
        ./configure
        make -j$(nproc)
        sudo make install
        cd ..
        ```

4.  **SDL2_ttf**
    *   Get source (e.g., `2.22.0`):
        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases/download/release-2.22.0/SDL2_ttf-2.22.0.tar.gz
        tar -zxvf SDL2_ttf-2.22.0.tar.gz
        cd SDL2_ttf-2.22.0
        ```
    *   Configure, build, install:
        ```bash
        ./configure
        make -j$(nproc)
        sudo make install
        cd ..
        ```

5.  **Update dynamic linker cache:**
    After installing new shared libraries, it's crucial to run:
    ```bash
    sudo ldconfig
    ```

**Phase 3: Reinstall Kivy**

Now that you have a custom-built SDL2, Kivy needs to be reinstalled to ensure it links against this new version.

1.  **Navigate to your Scorer project directory and activate the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/Scorer 
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Uninstall existing Kivy:**
    ```bash
    pip uninstall kivy Pillow # Also uninstall Pillow as it's often a Kivy dependency with compiled parts
    ```

3.  **Reinstall Kivy, forcing compilation:**
    `--no-cache-dir` ensures pip doesn't use a cached wheel.
    `--no-binary :all:` tells pip not to use any pre-built binary wheels for any package, forcing Kivy (and its dependencies like Pillow) to compile from source. This is key to making it link against your new SDL2.
    ```bash
    pip install --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all: kivy Pillow
    ```
    **Watch the Kivy installation output very carefully.** Look for any messages related to SDL2, KMS/DRM, EGL, GLES, or any compilation errors.

**Phase 4: Test**

1.  **Run the `kivy_backend_test.py` script again:**
    ```bash
    python3 kivy_backend_test.py
    ```
    Examine its output closely. We are hoping to:
    *   **NOT** see "Unable to connect to X server."
    *   See Kivy initialize successfully using the `sdl2` window provider.
    *   Ideally, see the simple Label from the test script rendered on your screen.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Version Numbers:** The SDL2 library versions I've used (`2.30.3`, `2.8.2`, etc.) are recent stable versions. You can check their respective GitHub release pages for the absolute latest if you prefer, but these should be fine.
*   **Compilation Time:** Compiling these libraries, especially SDL2 and Kivy, can take a significant amount of time on a Raspberry Pi (potentially 15-45 minutes or more for everything). Be patient.
*   **Errors:** If you encounter errors during any `configure` or `make` step, the error messages are crucial. They often point to missing development libraries or other issues.

This is a comprehensive process. Please take it step-by-step. Let me know if you encounter any issues at a particular step, and provide the error messages.

I'll provide these commands in chunks so it's easier to manage.

**First, please run the commands in "Phase 1: Preparation and Uninstalling Existing SDL2 Dev Libraries" on your Raspberry Pi.** Let me know when that's complete and if you encountered any issues. Then we'll move to Phase 2.

**User**

well that failed in the mddle of building SDL2_ttf

---

**Cursor**

Oh no, that's frustrating! A failure in the middle of a long compilation is always a pain.

To help me understand what went wrong with the `SDL2_ttf` build, could you please provide the following:

1.  **The last 20-30 lines of output from your terminal before and including the error message** when `make -j$(nproc)` failed for `SDL2_ttf`. The error messages are usually right at the end of the `make` output.
2.  Did the `configure` step for `SDL2_ttf` complete without errors?

Sometimes the error is due to a missing dependency that wasn't explicitly listed or caught earlier, or a subtle incompatibility.

Once I see the error, I can try to diagnose it. Common reasons for build failures include:

- Missing development libraries (e.g., FreeType for `SDL2_ttf`, HarfBuzz, etc.).
- Compiler errors (less common with stable library versions but possible).
- Out of memory (less likely on a Pi 5 for this, but possible during linking).

Let's see those error messages, and we'll figure out the next step. Don't worry, build issues are often solvable with a bit more information.

Ah, that's an unfortunate development. The line:

```
Read from remote host madlab5.local: Connection reset by peer
Connection to madlab5.local closed.
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
```

This means your SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi (`madlab5.local`) dropped during the compilation of `SDL2_ttf`. The compilation process itself on the Pi might have continued for a bit longer, or it might have been terminated if the shell it was running in was closed due to the disconnect.

**This is not necessarily a build failure of `SDL2_ttf` itself, but a network/connection issue.**

**What to do now:**

1.  **Reconnect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH.**

2.  **Check if the build process is still running (unlikely, but possible):**
    You can use a command like `htop` or `ps aux | grep make` to see if there are any `make` or `g++` processes still consuming a lot of CPU related to the `SDL2_ttf` build. If your connection was severed, the parent shell for the make command likely terminated, stopping the build.

3.  **Navigate back to the `SDL2_ttf` source directory:**
    Assuming you were following the steps, this would be:

    ```bash
    cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2_ttf-2.22.0
    ```

    (Adjust `SDL2_ttf-2.22.0` if you used a different version).

4.  **Clean up any partial build artifacts (important before retrying):**
    Run this command within the `SDL2_ttf-2.22.0` directory:

    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

    This will remove any compiled object files from the previous attempt, ensuring a fresh start for the build.

5.  **Retry the `make` and `sudo make install` for `SDL2_ttf`:**
    Still within the `SDL2_ttf-2.22.0` directory:
    ```bash
    ./configure  # Re-run configure to be safe, though it likely completed before
    make -j$(nproc)
    sudo make install
    ```

**Why the disconnect might have happened:**

- **Network hiccup:** Temporary loss of Wi-Fi or network connectivity.
- **Raspberry Pi resource exhaustion (less likely for just a disconnect, but possible if it was also under extreme load):** If the Pi became unresponsive due to very high CPU or memory load during compilation, the SSH connection could drop. `make -j$(nproc)` will use all available cores, which is good for speed but does put a heavy load on the system. If your Pi's power supply is marginal or it's overheating, this could be a factor.
- **SSH timeout settings:** Less likely for an active compilation, but some SSH client/server settings can cause disconnects during long periods without interactive input (though compilation output should keep it alive).

**Recommendation for long compilations:**

To prevent a disconnected SSH session from killing a long build process, it's often recommended to use a terminal multiplexer like `tmux` or `screen` on the Raspberry Pi.

- You start `tmux` (or `screen`) on the Pi.
- Run your long commands inside the `tmux` session.
- If your SSH connection drops, the `tmux` session (and the commands running within it) keeps running on the Pi.
- You can then reconnect via SSH and reattach to your `tmux` session to see the progress or results.

**For now, let's try the cleanup and retry for `SDL2_ttf`.**

Please try steps 1-5. If the `make -j$(nproc)` for `SDL2_ttf` fails again (and the SSH connection stays alive), then please provide the error output from the `make` command itself. If it succeeds, then proceed with `sudo make install` for `SDL2_ttf`, then `sudo ldconfig`, and then we can move to reinstalling Kivy.

```

```

```shellscript

    make -j$(nproc)
    sudo make install
```

**User**

it was a power loss

---

**Cursor**

Ah, a power loss explains the sudden disconnect perfectly! That's definitely an external factor rather than a build problem itself.

Okay, in that case, the Raspberry Pi would have shut down abruptly. When you power it back on:

1.  **Reconnect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH.**

2.  **Navigate back to the `SDL2_ttf` source directory:**
    This would be:

    ```bash
    cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2_ttf-2.22.0
    ```

    (Adjust `SDL2_ttf-2.22.0` if you used a different version).

3.  **Clean up any partial build artifacts:**
    A power loss during a write operation could potentially leave corrupted files. Running `make clean` is important.

    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

4.  **Re-run the `configure`, `make`, and `sudo make install` steps for `SDL2_ttf`:**
    Since the previous attempt was interrupted, it's best to start this library's build from the `configure` step.
    ```bash
    ./configure
    make -j$(nproc)
    sudo make install
    ```

If `SDL2_ttf` compiles and installs successfully this time, then you can proceed with:

5.  **Update dynamic linker cache:**

    ```bash
    sudo ldconfig
    ```

6.  **Move on to "Phase 3: Reinstall Kivy"** from my earlier instructions (navigate to `~/Scorer`, activate venv, uninstall Kivy/Pillow, then reinstall Kivy/Pillow with `--no-cache-dir --no-binary :all:`).

Hopefully, with stable power, the `SDL2_ttf` build will complete without issues. Let me know how it goes! If it fails for a different reason (an actual build error this time), please provide the error output.

```shellscript
    cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2_ttf-2.22.0
```

```shellscript
    make clean
```

```shellscript
    ./configure
    make -j$(nproc)
    sudo make install
```

```shellscript
    sudo ldconfig
```

---

**User**

show me how to run 6.

---

**Cursor**

Okay, you want to run step 6, which is **"Phase 3: Reinstall Kivy"**.

Assuming you've successfully completed all the steps for compiling and installing `SDL2`, `SDL2_image`, `SDL2_mixer`, and `SDL2_ttf` from source, and you've run `sudo ldconfig`, here's how to proceed with reinstalling Kivy:

**On your Raspberry Pi (via SSH):**

1.  **Navigate to your Scorer project directory:**
    This is where your `main.py` and the `.venv` directory are located.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Scorer
    ```

2.  **Activate your Python virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Your terminal prompt should change to indicate the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(.venv) matthewantone@madlab5:~/Scorer $`).

3.  **Uninstall existing Kivy and Pillow:**
    Pillow is a common dependency for Kivy that also has compiled components, so it's good to reinstall it to ensure it links correctly.

    ```bash
    pip uninstall kivy Pillow
    ```

    Confirm with `y` if prompted.

4.  **Reinstall Kivy and Pillow, forcing compilation:**

    - `--no-cache-dir`: This tells `pip` not to use any previously downloaded (and possibly pre-compiled) packages from its cache. It will force a fresh download of the source distributions.
    - `--no-binary :all:`: This is a crucial flag. It tells `pip` **not** to use any pre-compiled binary wheels for **any** package it installs in this command. This forces `pip` to download the source code for Kivy (and Pillow) and compile them on your Raspberry Pi. This compilation step is what should make them link against the custom-built SDL2 libraries you just installed.

    Run the command:

    ```bash
    pip install --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all: kivy Pillow
    ```

**Important things to do while this command runs:**

- **Be Patient:** This compilation process (especially for Kivy) can take a considerable amount of time on the Raspberry Pi – potentially 15-30 minutes or more.
- **Watch the Output Carefully:** Monitor the terminal output during the installation. Look for:
  - Any error messages during the compilation of Kivy or Pillow.
  - Messages related to `SDL2` (it might show which SDL2 configuration it's finding/using).
  - Any warnings about missing dependencies (though hopefully, Phase 1 installed everything needed).
- **Ensure Stable Power and Network:** Given the previous power loss, make sure your Pi has a stable power supply during this long command.

If the `pip install` command completes without errors, then Kivy should be reinstalled and linked against your custom SDL2 libraries.

After this is done, the next step would be "Phase 4: Test", where you run `python3 kivy_backend_test.py` again to see if the "Unable to connect to X server" message is gone and if the test app renders.

Let me know if the `pip install` command for Kivy and Pillow completes successfully or if you encounter any errors during that process!

```shellscript
    cd ~/Scorer
```

```shellscript
    source .venv/bin/activate
```

```shellscript
    pip uninstall kivy Pillow
```

```shellscript
    pip install --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all: kivy Pillow
```

This is the output from `kivy_backend_test.py` **after** you've gone through the entire process of:

1.  Uninstalling system SDL2 dev libraries.
2.  Compiling SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf from source with the KMSDRM flags.
3.  Running `sudo ldconfig`.
4.  Uninstalling Kivy and Pillow from the virtual environment.
5.  Reinstalling Kivy and Pillow using `pip install --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all: kivy Pillow`.

And unfortunately, the log shows:

```
...
[INFO   ] [Window      ] Provider: sdl2
[INFO   ] [GL          ] Using the "OpenGL" graphics system
[INFO   ] [GL          ] Backend used <sdl2>
...
Unable to connect to X server
...
[INFO   ] [Base        ] Start application main loop
...
```

**This is deeply frustrating. Despite all the effort to compile SDL2 specifically for KMS/DRM and disable its X11 video backend, and then recompiling Kivy against it, Kivy's `sdl2` provider is _still_ attempting to connect to an X server.**

And you're still getting a blank screen with the main app, I presume?

This outcome, after such a thorough procedure, suggests a few very stubborn possibilities:

1.  **SDL2 Build/Install Didn't Fully Override System Behavior:**

    - It's possible that even with `sudo make install` and `sudo ldconfig`, Kivy (or Python's ctypes, which Kivy uses to load libraries) is still somehow finding and prioritizing parts of the system's original SDL2 installation or expecting an X11 context due to other linked libraries or system configurations. This can be tricky with how linkers and library paths work.
    - The `./configure --enable-video-kmsdrm --disable-video-x11 ...` for SDL2 _should_ have built SDL2 in a way that it doesn't try X11 as its primary video target. The fact that the "Unable to connect to X server" message still comes from _within_ the Kivy/SDL2 stack is perplexing.

2.  **Kivy's `sdl2` Window Provider Has an Unconditional X11 Check/Preference on Linux:**

    - It's conceivable that Kivy's `WindowSDL` provider has a hardcoded preference or check for X11 on Linux systems that isn't bypassed by just unsetting `DISPLAY` or by the way our custom SDL2 is built. This would be a deeper Kivy-level issue.

3.  **Something Else in the Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm Graphics Stack:**

    - There might be another library or system service that Kivy or SDL2 indirectly interacts with, which itself tries to initialize an X11 connection or expects one, leading to this error.

4.  **Issue with the Touchscreen Driver Interaction:**
    - The logs show `[MTD         ] Read event from </dev/input/event5>`. While usually a good sign, sometimes input drivers can have weird interactions with graphics initialization if not everything is perfectly aligned. (Less likely to be the primary cause of the X server message, but worth noting).

**At this point, the "compile SDL2 from source" route, which was the most promising based on Kivy's own historical advice for similar problems, hasn't yielded the desired result.**

This is a very tough spot. Before we consider even more drastic measures (like trying to debug Kivy's C source code or SDL2's interaction at an even lower level), let's try one more, slightly less invasive, Kivy-specific environment variable that interacts with SDL2.

**Last Kivy/SDL2 Environment Variable Attempt:**

There's an environment variable `SDL_VIDEODRIVER`. If Kivy passes this through to SDL2, or if SDL2 picks it up directly, we can try to explicitly tell SDL2 which video driver to use. For KMS/DRM, it's often `KMSDRM` (sometimes case-sensitive, like `kmsdrm`).

Let's modify `kivy_backend_test.py` one last time to include this.

I'll prepare that change. This is a long shot given everything else, but it's worth trying before considering more extreme options or a framework change.

```

The `kivy_backend_test.py` script has been updated to include `os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'kmsdrm'` for Linux systems, right before other Kivy-specific environment variables.

**Please do the following:**

1.  **Ensure this latest version of `kivy_backend_test.py` is on your Raspberry Pi.**
2.  **On your Raspberry Pi (via SSH, in your activated virtual environment `~/Scorer/.venv/bin/activate`):**
    ```bash
    python3 kivy_backend_test.py
    ```
3.  **Provide the complete console output.**

We are looking to see if setting `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm` has _any_ impact on the Kivy startup logs, specifically:

- Does the "Unable to connect to X server" message disappear?
- Does Kivy report using a different window or GL provider, or does it show any errors related to `kmsdrm`?
- Does anything render on the screen?

This is one of the most direct ways to instruct SDL2 about which video driver to use. If this doesn't change the behavior, it would further indicate a very deep-seated issue in the SDL2/Kivy/OS interaction.

```shellscript
    python3 kivy_backend_test.py
```

```shellscript
    python3 kivy_backend_test.py
```

This is a significant new development in the logs!

MinimalTestApp.build(): Kivy Window provider: NoneType
Minimal Test: An unexpected error occurred: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'size'
```

**Key Breakthroughs and New Problems:**

1.  **`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm` IS Being Respected (Partially):**

    - The line `[DEBUG  ] [Window      ] Provider <x11> ignored by config` is new and very important. This suggests that by setting `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm`, we _have_ successfully told SDL2 (and Kivy through it) not to even _try_ X11. This is a big step, as the "Unable to connect to X server" message is now gone!

2.  **`kmsdrm not available` - The New Core Issue:**

    - The critical error is now: `sdl2 - RuntimeError: b'kmsdrm not available'`.
    - This means that while SDL2 acknowledged our request to use the `kmsdrm` video driver, it then determined that this driver is actually not available or couldn't be initialized.
    - This happens during `WindowSDL.create_window()` -> `_window_sdl2.setup_window()`.

3.  **Kivy Fails to Find a Window Provider:**
    - Because `kmsdrm` failed, and X11 was explicitly ignored, Kivy couldn't find _any_ usable window provider, leading to: `[CRITICAL] [Window      ] Unable to find any valuable Window provider.`
    - This results in `Window` being `None`, which then causes the script to crash later with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'size'` when `MinimalTestApp.build()` tries to access `Window.size`.

**Why would `kmsdrm` be "not available" to SDL2, even after we compiled SDL2 with `--enable-video-kmsdrm`?**

- **Missing Kernel Modules or Permissions (Less Likely Now):** We checked `vc4-kms-v3d` (it's active) and user group memberships (`video`, `render` - user is in them). This makes fundamental permission/kernel module issues less probable, _but not impossible_ if SDL2 has very specific expectations.
- **SDL2 Build Configuration Issue (Still Possible):**
  - Perhaps the `./configure --enable-video-kmsdrm --disable-video-x11 --disable-video-wayland --disable-video-rpi --disable-video-opengl` flags for SDL2 were not sufficient, or some other feature that `kmsdrm` depends on was inadvertently disabled or not found during SDL2's `configure` stage.
  - It's also possible that although we compiled SDL2 from source, the Kivy build process (when we reinstalled Kivy with `--no-binary :all:`) didn't link against our custom SDL2 correctly and is still somehow picking up parts of an older system SDL2 that lacks proper KMSDRM, or that Kivy's own compiled components for SDL2 interaction weren't built with the right assumptions. However, `ldconfig` _should_ have prioritized our manually installed SDL2.
- **Mesa/DRM/GBM Library Issues:** The `kmsdrm` video driver in SDL2 relies on Mesa (for OpenGL ES), DRM (Direct Rendering Manager), and GBM (Generic Buffer Management). If there's an issue with these underlying libraries on your Pi 5 / Bookworm setup, or if SDL2 can't find or use them correctly, `kmsdrm` initialization would fail. The `libdrm-dev` and `libgbm-dev` were in our install list.
- **Raspberry Pi 5 Specifics:** The RPi 5's graphics stack is newer. While `vc4-kms-v3d` is the driver, there might be subtle ways SDL2 needs to interact with it that aren't perfectly aligned in the version of SDL2 we compiled or how it was configured.

**Next Steps - Digging into SDL2's `kmsdrm` Failure:**

This is progress, as we've shifted the error from "X11 not found" to "kmsdrm not found/usable by SDL2."

1.  **Examine SDL2 `config.log`:**

    - When you ran `./configure` for SDL2 (`cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2-2.30.3; ./configure ...`), it created a `config.log` file in that directory. This log contains detailed information about what the configure script found (or didn't find) on your system.
    - **Action:** Please find this `config.log` file (on your Raspberry Pi at `~/sdl2_build/SDL2-2.30.3/config.log`) and either:
      _ Copy its content and paste it here.
      _ Use a tool like `grep` to search within it for terms like "kms", "drm", "gbm", "egl", "gles", and any errors or "not found" messages.
      For example:
      `bash
    cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2-2.30.3
    grep -C 5 -iE 'kms|drm|gbm|egl|gles|error|not found|warning' config.log
    `
      This log might tell us if SDL2's configure script had trouble finding necessary components for its `kmsdrm` backend.

2.  **Consider SDL2 Version:** We used SDL2 `2.30.3`. While recent, it's possible a slightly older or even a development snapshot of SDL2 might have different behavior with the RPi 5. (This is a more advanced step).

3.  **Alternative SDL_VIDEODRIVER value?** Sometimes `rpi` is used for older DispmanX, but that's not what we want. `KMSDRM` (all caps) or `kmsdrm` (lowercase) are the usual suspects. `fbcon` (Linux framebuffer console) is another much more basic one, but Kivy usually needs OpenGL ES, which `fbcon` alone doesn't provide in the same way.

Let's start by examining the `config.log` from your SDL2 build. That's the most likely place to find clues about why `kmsdrm` might be considered unavailable by the SDL2 library we built.

```

Ah, you're right! I tried to list the directory from my environment, but that `sdl2_build` directory and the `config.log` file are on your **Raspberry Pi**, not on your macOS machine. My apologies for that oversight.

**Please, on your Raspberry Pi:**

1.  Navigate to the SDL2 source directory where you ran the `./configure` command:

    ```bash
    cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2-2.30.3
    ```

    (Adjust `SDL2-2.30.3` if you used a different version number).

2.  Then, run the `grep` command to search within the `config.log` file:

    ```bash
    grep -C 5 -iE 'kms|drm|gbm|egl|gles|error|not found|warning' config.log
    ```

3.  **Paste the output of that `grep` command here.**

This will help us see if the SDL2 `configure` script logged any issues related to KMS, DRM, GBM, EGL, or GLES, which are all crucial for the `kmsdrm` video driver to function.

```shellscript
    cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2-2.30.3
```

```shellscript
    grep -C 5 -iE 'kms|drm|gbm|egl|gles|error|not found|warning' config.log
```

```shellscript
    cd ~/sdl2_build/SDL2-2.30.3
```

```shellscript
    grep -C 5 -iE 'kms|drm|gbm|egl|gles|error|not found|warning' config.log
```

**User**

my terminal only had this in it's buffer.

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I've analyzed the snippet of the `config.log` you provided.

**Key Findings from the Log Snippet:**

1.  **KMSDRM Support Configured:** The configure script **did** detect the necessary components for KMSDRM:

    - `libdrm` (version >= 1.4.82) was found.
    - `gbm` (version >= 11.1.0) was found.
    - EGL support was enabled.
    - OpenGL ES 1 and ES2 header support was enabled.
    - Most importantly, the configuration set `#define SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER_KMSDRM 1`, and identified `libdrm.so.2` and `libgbm.so.1` as dynamic libraries for KMSDRM.

    This means that SDL2 _should_ have been compiled with the KMSDRM video backend enabled.

2.  **`iconv` Issue:**

    - There was an initial failure: `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -liconv`. This means it couldn't link a test program with a library explicitly named `libiconv`.
    - However, a subsequent check for the `iconv()` function (without trying to link `-liconv`) passed. This suggests `iconv` functionality is available, likely from the standard C library (`libc`). This is probably not the root cause of the KMSDRM issue but is a slight anomaly in the build log.

3.  **Other Checks:**
    - Failures to find x86-specific SIMD extensions (MMX, SSE, etc.) are normal and expected on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi.
    - Audio backends (ALSA, PulseAudio, Jack, etc.) were mostly detected, which is unrelated to the video issue.

**Conclusion from the Log Snippet:**
The `config.log` indicates that SDL2 was configured to build the KMSDRM backend. The error message `RuntimeError: b'kmsdrm not available'` that you're seeing when `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm` is set suggests that even though SDL2 was compiled with KMSDRM support, it's failing to initialize or use that backend at runtime.

This could be due to several reasons:

- The necessary runtime shared libraries (`libdrm.so.2`, `libgbm.so.1`) are missing, corrupted, not found by the dynamic linker, or are incompatible versions.
- The underlying kernel DRM/KMS system (`vc4-kms-v3d`) is not functioning correctly or is inaccessible.
- An internal initialization step within SDL2's KMSDRM driver is failing.

**Next Troubleshooting Steps on the Raspberry Pi:**

Let's try to diagnose this further. Please run these commands on your Raspberry Pi and show me the output:

1.  **Check for essential runtime libraries and their development packages:**
    I want to see if the core libraries that KMSDRM depends on are installed and what versions they are.

My apologies, I missed a parameter in the previous command.

Let's try that again. Please run this command on your Raspberry Pi and show me the output:

1.  **Check for essential runtime libraries and their development packages:**
    I want to see if the core libraries that KMSDRM depends on are installed and what versions they are.

**User**

ehre

**Cursor**

Okay, thank you for providing that output!

From the list, we can see:

- `libdrm-dev` and `libdrm2` (version 2.4.123) are installed.
- `libgbm-dev` and `libgbm1` (version 24.2.8) are installed.
- `libgles2-mesa` (version 22.3.6) is installed.
- `libudev-dev` and `libudev1` (version 252.38) are installed.

These are all good signs, as these libraries are essential dependencies for the KMS/DRM backend. The versions look modern.

One library that was in my requested list but not explicitly in your output is `libegl1-mesa`. EGL is the interface between Khronos rendering APIs (like OpenGL ES) and the native platform window system. It's crucial for KMS/DRM. It's possible it's installed under a slightly different name or as a dependency of another package.

Let's try the following commands on your Raspberry Pi to get more details:

1.  **Check if `libegl1-mesa` is installed, or find what provides `libEGL.so.1`:**

---

**User**

jhere

**Cursor**

Okay, that's good. It confirms that `libegl1` is installed, which provides the necessary EGL runtime libraries.

So far, the key libraries (`libdrm2`, `libgbm1`, `libegl1`, `libgles2-mesa`, `libudev1`) all seem to be present. The SDL2 `config.log` indicated that SDL2 was _configured_ to build the KMSDRM backend. The persistent `RuntimeError: b'kmsdrm not available'` when `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm` is set is the main puzzle. This error is likely coming from SDL2 itself during its video backend initialization.

To understand _why_ SDL2 thinks KMSDRM is unavailable, we need to enable more detailed logging from SDL2.

Here's what I propose:

1.  **Modify `kivy_backend_test.py` on your Raspberry Pi:**
    Please add the following `os.environ` lines at the top of your `kivy_backend_test.py` script, _before_ `from kivy.app import App` and before the line where you set `SDL_VIDEODRIVER`. This will enable verbose logging for all SDL categories.

    ```python
    import os
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_PRIORITY'] = 'VERBOSE' # Use 'VERBOSE' for maximum detail
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_ERROR'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_VIDEO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_RENDER'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_INPUT'] = 'VERBOSE'

    # Your existing line to force kmsdrm
    os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'kmsdrm'

    # ... rest of your kivy_backend_test.py script ...
    ```

2.  **Run the modified `kivy_backend_test.py` on the Raspberry Pi:**
    Execute the script from the command line: `python kivy_backend_test.py`

3.  **Provide the Full Output:**
    Please copy and paste the entire console output from running the script. This should now include much more detailed logs from SDL2 itself, hopefully explaining why it's unable to use the KMSDRM backend.

4.  **Additionally, check kernel messages:**
    Immediately after running the test script (especially if it still fails), run the following command on the Pi and share its output. This will show if there are any kernel-level errors related to DRM, KMS, or the graphics drivers:

```python
    import os
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_PRIORITY'] = 'VERBOSE' # Use 'VERBOSE' for maximum detail
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_ERROR'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_VIDEO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_RENDER'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_INPUT'] = 'VERBOSE'

    # Your existing line to force kmsdrm
    os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'kmsdrm'

    # ... rest of your kivy_backend_test.py script ...
```

**User**

update the test here on macOs I'll move it. I prefer you see the files too

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I understand. I will update the `kivy_backend_test.py` file with the SDL verbose logging environment variables. You can then transfer this updated file to your Raspberry Pi.

First, I'll read the current content of `kivy_backend_test.py` to ensure I'm adding the new lines correctly.

Okay, I have the content of `kivy_backend_test.py`. Now I will add the SDL verbose logging environment variables at the beginning of the script, specifically before the `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` is set.

```python
import platform
import os
import sys

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Python executable: {sys.executable}")

if platform.system() == "Linux":
    print("Minimal Test: Linux detected. Setting Kivy and SDL2 environment variables for SDL2/KMSDRM.")
    # Add SDL Verbose Logging
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_PRIORITY'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_ERROR'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_VIDEO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_RENDER'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_INPUT'] = 'VERBOSE'

    os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'kmsdrm'
// ... existing code ...

```

The `kivy_backend_test.py` file has been updated with the SDL verbose logging environment variables.

Here's the relevant part of the updated script:

```python
import platform
import os
import sys

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Python executable: {sys.executable}")

if platform.system() == "Linux":
    print("Minimal Test: Linux detected. Setting Kivy and SDL2 environment variables for SDL2/KMSDRM.")
    # Add SDL Verbose Logging
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_PRIORITY'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_ERROR'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_VIDEO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_RENDER'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_INPUT'] = 'VERBOSE'

    os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'kmsdrm'
    os.environ['KIVY_WINDOW'] = 'sdl2'
    # ... rest of the script
```

Please transfer this updated `kivy_backend_test.py` to your Raspberry Pi.

Then, on the Raspberry Pi:

1.  Run the modified `kivy_backend_test.py`: `python kivy_backend_test.py`
2.  Copy and paste the **entire console output** here.
3.  Immediately after the script finishes (or fails), run `dmesg | tail -n 50` and provide that output as well.

This detailed logging should give us much better insight into why SDL2 is reporting `kmsdrm not available`.

```python
import platform
import os
import sys

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Python executable: {sys.executable}")

if platform.system() == "Linux":
    print("Minimal Test: Linux detected. Setting Kivy and SDL2 environment variables for SDL2/KMSDRM.")
    # Add SDL Verbose Logging
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_PRIORITY'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_ERROR'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_AUDIO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_VIDEO'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_RENDER'] = 'VERBOSE'
    os.environ['SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_INPUT'] = 'VERBOSE'

    os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER'] = 'kmsdrm'
    os.environ['KIVY_WINDOW'] = 'sdl2'
    # ... rest of the script
```

first the backend test . then kernel test

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I've analyzed the output from `kivy_backend_test.py` and `dmesg`.

**Analysis of `kivy_backend_test.py` Output:**

1.  **SDL Verbose Logging Not Present:** The Kivy logs you provided (`[INFO   ] [Logger      ]`, etc.) are standard Kivy logs. We are not seeing the detailed `SDL: ` prefixed logs that we'd expect if `os.environ['SDL_LOG_PRIORITY'] = 'VERBOSE'` and the other `SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_...` variables were taking effect _before_ SDL initializes.

    - The most critical lines are still:
      ```
      [INFO   ] [Window      ] Provider: sdl2
      [DEBUG  ] [Window      ] Provider <x11> ignored by config
      [CRITICAL] [Window      ] Unable to find any valuable Window provider.
      sdl2 - RuntimeError: b'kmsdrm not available'
      ```
    - This sequence means Kivy is trying to use its `sdl2` window provider. SDL2, when invoked, first notes that X11 is not to be used (good, because `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm` is set). But then SDL2 itself fails to initialize its KMSDRM backend, reporting it as "not available." Kivy then has no usable window provider and fails.

2.  **Error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'size'`:** This is a downstream error. It happens because `Window` object was never successfully created due to the `kmsdrm not available` error, so `Window` is `None` when `MinimalTestApp.build()` tries to access `Window.size`.

**Analysis of `dmesg` Output:**

- **No Obvious KMS/DRM Errors:** The `dmesg` log looks relatively clean in terms of critical graphics errors around the time you would have run the test.
  - We see `drm-rp1-dsi ... fb0: drm-rp1-dsidrmf frame buffer device` and `rp1dsi_bind succeeded`, which is the Display Serial Interface for the official Pi touchscreen initializing. This is good.
  - The `edt_ft5x06 ... supply iovcc not found` is for the touchscreen controller and is a common, usually non-fatal, message if a particular power supply isn't defined in the device tree; it typically falls back to a dummy regulator and still works.
  - The `Undervoltage detected!` and `Voltage normalised` messages are common on Raspberry Pis, especially if the power supply isn't perfectly stable or if peripherals draw a lot of current. While not ideal, it's unlikely to be the direct cause of the `kmsdrm not available` error unless it's very severe and persistent, which doesn't seem to be the case here as it normalized.
- No messages like "failed to load kmsdrm," "drm error," or "gbm error" are appearing.

**Conclusion and Next Steps:**

The primary issue remains that SDL2, despite being compiled with KMSDRM support (as suggested by the `config.log`) and all dev libraries being present, cannot initialize its KMSDRM video driver at runtime. Since the verbose SDL logs didn't appear, it's possible the environment variables are not being set early enough or in the correct scope for SDL's very first initialization point.

Let's try to get the SDL verbose logs using a different method. Instead of setting them in Python (where the timing relative to Kivy's first import of SDL might be tricky), let's set them _before_ running the Python script.

**Please try the following on your Raspberry Pi:**

1.  **Run `kivy_backend_test.py` with environment variables set directly in the command:**

    ```bash
    SDL_LOG_PRIORITY=VERBOSE SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_VIDEO=VERBOSE SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM=VERBOSE SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm python3 kivy_backend_test.py
    ```

    - This command sets the crucial environment variables just for this execution of the script. We're focusing on `VIDEO` and `SYSTEM` categories for SDL, as those are most likely to give us clues about KMSDRM initialization.

2.  **Provide the Full Output:**
    Please copy and paste the entire console output from running this command. We are specifically looking for lines prefixed with `SDL:` that might give more details about the `kmsdrm not available` error.

This approach ensures SDL sees these environment variables from its earliest startup. If KMSDRM is truly misconfigured or missing a runtime dependency that `ldd` didn't catch, these logs are our best bet to find out why.

```plaintext
        [INFO   ] [Window      ] Provider: sdl2
        [DEBUG  ] [Window      ] Provider <x11> ignored by config
        [CRITICAL] [Window      ] Unable to find any valuable Window provider.
        sdl2 - RuntimeError: b'kmsdrm not available'
```

```shellscript
    SDL_LOG_PRIORITY=VERBOSE SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_VIDEO=VERBOSE SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_SYSTEM=VERBOSE SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm python3 kivy_backend_test.py
```

It's very strange that we're still not seeing the verbose SDL logs, even when setting the environment variables directly in the command line before launching Python. This strongly suggests that either the SDL library Kivy is using isn't the one we expect (and thus doesn't have the logging behavior or KMSDRM support we think it does), or there's a very early, silent failure within SDL's KMSDRM driver initialization.

Let's focus on identifying exactly which `libSDL2.so` file Kivy's components are linked against.

Please run the following commands on your Raspberry Pi and show me the output:

1.  **Find the full path to Kivy's compiled SDL2 window module:**
    This module is the bridge between Kivy's Python code and the C SDL2 library.

Okay, thank you! Now that we have the exact path to Kivy's `_window_sdl2.cpython-311-aarch64-linux-gnu.so` module, we can use `ldd` on it to see which `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` (the main SDL2 shared library) it's actually linking against at runtime.

Please run this command on your Raspberry Pi and show me the output:

This `ldd` output is the smoking gun!

Look at this line:
`libSDL2-2.0.so.0 => /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so.0 (0x00007fffa9220000)`

This tells us that Kivy's `_window_sdl2.cpython-311-aarch64-linux-gnu.so` module is **linking against the system-installed SDL2 library** located at `/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so.0`, **NOT** the custom-compiled version that we built from source and installed into `/usr/local/lib`.

This explains everything:

1.  **Why KMSDRM is "not available":** The system-packaged SDL2 on Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm likely doesn't have the KMSDRM video driver enabled by default or is built in a way that expects X11 or Wayland, even if they aren't running. Our custom-compiled version was specifically built to enable KMSDRM and disable X11/Wayland.
2.  **Why SDL verbose logs didn't appear:** We were trying to enable logging for the custom-compiled SDL2, but Kivy was using the system one, which might have different logging compile-time flags or behaviors.
3.  **Why `config.log` for our custom build looked okay:** The configuration for _our_ build of SDL2 was indeed correct, but that version isn't the one being used by Kivy.

**The Problem:**
When Kivy (specifically its Cython-compiled `_window_sdl2` module) was installed via `pip install kivy`, it linked against the first `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` it found in the standard library search paths. At that time, the system version in `/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/` was likely the one it found and preferred, or our custom `/usr/local/lib` wasn't properly prioritized by the dynamic linker during Kivy's installation.

**The Solution:**
We need to force Kivy to recompile its Cython modules and ensure it links against our custom-built SDL2 in `/usr/local/lib`.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Uninstall Kivy and its dependencies (Pillow) from the venv:** This is to ensure a clean slate.
2.  **Ensure `/usr/local/lib` is prioritized by the linker:** We can do this by setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` _before_ reinstalling Kivy.
3.  **Reinstall Kivy, forcing it to recompile from source and hopefully link against our SDL2:** We'll use `--no-cache-dir --no-binary :all:` again.

**Commands to run on your Raspberry Pi:**

First, ensure you are **inside your virtual environment** (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

1.  **Uninstall Kivy and Pillow:**

Great. Now, let's reinstall Kivy and Pillow, making sure the linker prioritizes `/usr/local/lib` where your custom SDL2 is installed.

2.  **Reinstall Kivy and Pillow, prioritizing your custom SDL2 library path:**
    Run this command on your Raspberry Pi (still within the activated venv):

this is running now. but it is very slow on a pi. is there a way to speed this up?

hey

are you there?
