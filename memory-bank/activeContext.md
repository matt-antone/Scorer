# Active Context

## Current Focus

- WebSocket server implementation for real-time game state updates
- Testing and validation of WebSocket functionality
- Database integration preparation

## Recent Changes

- Implemented WebSocket server using Flask-SocketIO
- Created web client interface for real-time updates
- Added game state broadcasting functionality
- Integrated WebSocket server with main application
- Installed required dependencies (python-dotenv, asyncpg)

## Active Decisions

- Using Flask-SocketIO for WebSocket implementation
- Port 6969 for WebSocket server to avoid conflicts
- Maintaining JSON-based system until database integration is complete
- Web client interface for testing and monitoring

## Current Considerations

- Testing WebSocket server stability and performance
- Validating real-time updates across all game state changes
- Preparing for database integration
- Monitoring for any platform-specific issues

## Next Steps

1. Thorough testing of WebSocket functionality
2. Implement error handling and reconnection logic
3. Consider authentication for web interface
4. Begin database integration planning
5. Document WebSocket API for future client implementations

## Open Questions

- Should we implement authentication for the web interface?
- What additional error handling is needed for production?
- How to handle WebSocket reconnection scenarios?
- What metrics should we track for WebSocket performance?

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring stable WebSocket connections
- Managing concurrent client connections
- Handling game state synchronization
- Platform-specific testing requirements

## Environment Notes

- Development on macOS
- Target deployment on Raspberry Pi
- Virtual environment management
- Dependencies:
  - Flask-SocketIO
  - python-socketio
  - python-dotenv
  - asyncpg
  - SQLAlchemy
  - aiosqlite
