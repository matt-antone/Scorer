# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Application is now running stably on both development (macOS) and production (Raspberry Pi) environments
- Fixed recursion issue in game state loading
- Systemd service is properly configured for auto-start

## Recent Changes

- Fixed game state loading recursion issue
- Improved systemd service configuration
- Ensured proper display and touchscreen configuration on Raspberry Pi

## Next Steps

- Test application on both platforms:
  - macOS development environment
  - Raspberry Pi production environment
- Verify all game features:
  - Player name entry
  - Deployment setup
  - First turn setup
  - Game scoring
  - Timer functionality
  - Game state persistence

## Active Decisions

- Using systemd service for application management
- Kivy configuration optimized for both platforms
- Game state persistence using JSON file storage
