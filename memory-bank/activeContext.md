# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Implementing and fixing missing properties and methods in four key screens:
  1. DeploymentSetupScreen
  2. GameOverScreen
  3. InitiativeScreen
  4. NameEntryScreen

## Recent Changes

- Added missing methods to DeploymentSetupScreen:
  - `validate_roll`: Validates roll values against configured min/max values
  - `validate_roll_sequence`: Validates a player's roll sequence
- Added missing methods to GameOverScreen:
  - `cleanup_game_state`: Handles game state cleanup after game over
  - `handle_cleanup_error`: Manages cleanup error states
- Added missing methods to InitiativeScreen:
  - `determine_initiative`: Determines initiative based on roll results
  - `select_first_turn`: Handles first turn selection
- Added missing method to NameEntryScreen:
  - `handle_name_validation_error`: Manages name validation errors

## Current Status

- All four screens now have complete implementations of required methods
- Methods follow project patterns for:
  - Error handling
  - State management
  - UI updates
  - Game state synchronization
  - Client updates
- Tests need to be run on Raspberry Pi for full verification

## Next Steps

1. Verify screen functionality on Raspberry Pi
2. Run full test suite on target platform
3. Address any issues found during testing
4. Document any new patterns or requirements discovered

## Active Decisions

- Maintaining consistent error handling patterns across all screens
- Using game state as source of truth for screen transitions
- Implementing proper cleanup and state management
- Following established UI update patterns

## Current Considerations

- Need to ensure proper synchronization between screens
- Must maintain consistent state management
- Error handling must be robust and user-friendly
- UI updates must be smooth and responsive

## 2024-06-12 Progress Update

- All InitiativeScreen tests now pass after fixing:
  - Initiative winner/loser logic
  - Tie handling
  - Added reset_rolls for test compatibility
- All NameEntryScreen tests now pass after fixing:
  - Validation and state properties
  - Ensuring player_names, qr_code, qr_code_valid, qr_code_error, and name_validation are always set in game state
- Next: Proceed to DeploymentSetupScreen and GameOverScreen to fix remaining test failures.

## 2024-06-13: UI Modularization and KV Warning Cleanup

- Consolidated all button styles into `button_styles.kv`.
- Removed all direct `Builder.load_file` calls for button styles from individual screen files.
- `button_styles.kv` is now included only once in `scorer.kv`.
- This resolved duplicate KV/class warnings and ensures maintainability.
- Change aligns with canonical directory structure (see systemPatterns.md).
- Rationale and pattern documented in .cursorrules.
