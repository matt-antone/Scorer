# Change: State Management Design Decision

## Date: 2024-05-20

## Description

Designed a centralized state management system to address inconsistent state handling across screens. This is the first step in implementing the systemic fixes identified in the common implementation patterns analysis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Design Documentation

- Created decision record: [State Management Design](../decisions/state_management_design.md)
- Defined core state properties
- Designed validation system
- Planned state transitions
- Outlined persistence hooks
- Designed event system

### 2. Implementation Planning

- Created phased implementation plan:
  1. Core State
  2. Validation
  3. Persistence
  4. Events

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Added cross-references to related decisions
- Updated active context
- Linked to systemic fixes analysis

## Related Decisions

- [State Management Design](../decisions/state_management_design.md)
- [Common Implementation Patterns](../decisions/common_implementation_patterns.md)

## Verification Steps

1. Review state property definitions
2. Verify validation requirements
3. Check transition logic
4. Validate persistence design
5. Review event system design

## Impact

- Will affect all screen implementations
- Requires systematic updates
- Improves state consistency
- Enables better debugging
- Simplifies maintenance

## Notes

- This is the first step in implementing systemic fixes
- All screens will need to be updated to use the new state system
- Documentation should be updated as implementation progresses
- Testing framework should be created alongside implementation
