# Change: Systemic Implementation Fixes Analysis

## Date: 2024-05-20

## Description

Analyzed common implementation patterns and systemic issues across all screens to identify root causes of discrepancies and plan holistic fixes before individual screen implementations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Analysis of Common Patterns

- Identified 5 major systemic issues:
  1. State Management Issues
  2. UI Component Standardization
  3. Validation and Error Handling
  4. Screen Lifecycle Management
  5. Documentation-Implementation Sync

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Created decision record: [Common Implementation Patterns](../decisions/common_implementation_patterns.md)
- Updated active context to reflect new focus
- Added cross-references to related changes

### 3. Implementation Planning

- Created phased implementation plan:
  1. Foundation (State, BaseScreen, Validation, Lifecycle)
  2. Components (Widgets, Error Handling, State Persistence, UI Patterns)
  3. Integration (Screen Updates, Documentation, Feature Flags, Sync)

## Related Decisions

- [Common Implementation Patterns](../decisions/common_implementation_patterns.md)
- [Asset Directory Structure](../decisions/asset_directory_structure.md)

## Verification Steps

1. Review all identified patterns
2. Verify implementation plan completeness
3. Check cross-references
4. Validate against existing screens

## Impact

- Will affect all screen implementations
- Requires systematic updates
- Improves maintainability
- Reduces future bugs

## Notes

- This analysis should be used as a guide for all future screen implementations
- Individual screen fixes should wait until systemic issues are addressed
- Documentation should be updated as patterns are implemented
