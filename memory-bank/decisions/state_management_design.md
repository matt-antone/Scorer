# Decision: State Management Design

## Context

The application needs a robust state management system to handle game state, screen transitions, and data persistence. Current implementation has inconsistent state handling across screens, leading to bugs and maintenance issues.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Global Variables**

   - Pros:
     - Simple to implement
     - Easy to access
   - Cons:
     - No validation
     - No state transitions
     - Hard to track changes
     - No persistence hooks

2. **Event-Based System**

   - Pros:
     - Decoupled components
     - Easy to extend
   - Cons:
     - Complex to debug
     - State can become inconsistent
     - Hard to track state history

3. **Centralized State Class (Chosen)**
   - Pros:
     - Single source of truth
     - Built-in validation
     - Clear state transitions
     - Easy to persist
     - Simple to debug
   - Cons:
     - More initial setup
     - Need to pass state object

## Decision

Implement a centralized `GameState` class with the following features:

1. **Core State Properties**

   ```python
   class GameState:
       # Game Setup
       player1_name: str
       player2_name: str
       attacker_id: int  # 1 or 2
       first_turn_player_id: int  # 1 or 2

       # Game Progress
       current_round: int
       current_player_id: int  # 1 or 2
       game_start_time: datetime
       last_action_time: datetime

       # Scores
       player1_primary: int
       player1_secondary: int
       player2_primary: int
       player2_secondary: int

       # Game Status
       is_game_active: bool
       is_game_paused: bool
       is_game_over: bool
   ```

2. **State Validation**

   - Property decorators for validation
   - Type checking
   - Value range validation
   - State transition validation

3. **State Transitions**

   - Clear transition methods
   - Validation before transitions
   - Event emission after transitions
   - State history tracking

4. **Persistence Hooks**

   - Automatic saving
   - Loading from saved state
   - State recovery
   - Backup creation

5. **Event System**
   - State change events
   - Validation events
   - Error events
   - Transition events

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core State

1. Create `GameState` class
2. Implement core properties
3. Add basic validation
4. Create transition methods

### Phase 2: Validation

1. Add property decorators
2. Implement type checking
3. Add value validation
4. Create transition validation

### Phase 3: Persistence

1. Add save/load methods
2. Implement state recovery
3. Add backup system
4. Create migration system

### Phase 4: Events

1. Add event system
2. Implement event handlers
3. Add error handling
4. Create event logging

## Verification Steps

- [ ] All properties are properly typed
- [ ] Validation works for all properties
- [ ] Transitions are properly validated
- [ ] State is correctly persisted
- [ ] Events are properly emitted
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] State recovery works

## Impact

- Consistent state management
- Reduced bugs
- Better debugging
- Easier maintenance
- Reliable persistence

## Future Considerations

- Add state visualization
- Implement undo/redo
- Add state analytics
- Create state testing framework
