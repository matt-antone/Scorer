# Progress

This document tracks the current working state of the Scorer application, what's left to build, and any known issues.

## What Works

The application is currently in a stable and functional state.

- **Kivy Application (macOS & Raspberry Pi):**

  - Fully functional for all core game management: score, CP, and round tracking.
  - Stable UI with consistent screen transitions.
  - Game timer functions correctly.
  - Handles saving and loading game state, including the "Resume or New Game" flow.
  - Launches correctly on both platforms via the `launch_scorer.sh` script.

- **Server & Web Client:**

  - The WebSocket server runs reliably in a background thread.
  - The web client successfully connects and receives real-time game state updates.
  - The client's screen flow (`Splash` -> `Name Entry` -> `Game` -> `Game Over`) is now correctly synchronized with the Kivy application's `game_phase`.
  - The critical "stuck on Game Over screen" bug has been resolved.

- **Architecture & State Management:**
  - The server-side state sanitization layer ensures the client only receives clean, valid data.
  - The `game_phase` is now managed reliably, creating a predictable state machine for both the Kivy app and the web client.
  - The data models (internal and client-facing) are clearly defined in `systemPatterns.md`.

## What's Left to Build

- **Settings Screen:** A dedicated screen for application settings (e.g., sound, display options) in the Kivy app is designed in the workflow but not yet implemented.
- **Dicer Integration:** Future integration with the "Dicer" AI system is planned but not started.
- **Performance Optimization:** While performance is currently acceptable, targeted optimization has not been a focus.
- **Player Client for Score Updates:** Implement a separate, mobile-first web client designed specifically for players. This client will:
  - Allow a player to modify only their own Score and CP.
  - Feature a minimal UI without the splash or game over screens of the main spectator client.
  - Be accessible via player-specific QR codes generated on the Kivy app's Name Entry screen.

## Current Status

- **Overall:** The project is stable. The primary Kivy application and the web client viewer are fully functional for their core purpose. The main development effort of fixing the client-server synchronization is complete.
- **Focus:** The current focus is on completing the memory bank audit and ensuring all documentation is accurate and consolidated.

## Known Issues

- There are currently no known critical bugs. The application is in a known-good, working state.

## Blockers

- There are no active blockers.
