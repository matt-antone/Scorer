# Progress: Scorer

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Recovery from broken state
- **Overall Progress**: Need to restore to last working state
- **Last Update**: Pi not booting, application untested
- **Next Steps**: Reinstall Pi OS, restore working state

## What Works

- Last known working state (commit b86e7d4):
  - Core Kivy application functionality
  - Game state persistence
  - Screen transitions
  - Score and CP tracking
  - Timer functionality
  - Platform-specific configurations

## What's Broken

- Raspberry Pi not booting after SDL2/KMSDRM configuration
- Application state untested on both platforms
- Need to verify working configuration after restore

## Next Steps

1. Reinstall Raspberry Pi OS
2. Restore application to last working state
3. Test on macOS first
4. Test on Pi after reinstallation
5. Document working configuration

## Known Issues

- Pi not booting after SDL2/KMSDRM configuration
- Application state untested on both platforms
- Need to verify working configuration after restore

## Blockers

- Pi OS needs reinstallation
- Application needs restoration to working state
- Need to verify working configuration
