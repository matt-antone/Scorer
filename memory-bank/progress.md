# Progress

This document tracks the current working state of the Scorer application, what's left to build, and any known issues.

## What Works

- **Automated Installation & Deployment:**

  - The `install.sh` script provides a fully automated setup process on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS.
  - It correctly installs system and Python dependencies, creates the database structure and source code, and initializes the SQLite database.
  - The application is confirmed to be fully functional on the target Raspberry Pi 5 hardware after installation.

- **Kivy Application (macOS & Raspberry Pi):**

  - Fully functional for all core game management: score, CP, and round tracking.
  - Stable UI with consistent screen transitions.
  - Game timer functions correctly.
  - Handles saving and loading game state, including the "Resume or New Game" flow.
  - Launches correctly on both platforms via the `launch_scorer.sh` script.

- **Server & Web Client:**

  - The WebSocket server runs reliably.
  - The web client connects, receives real-time updates, and correctly follows the game state.
  - A "No Connection" screen gracefully handles server disconnects.
  - The client's screen flow is synchronized with the Kivy application's `game_phase`.

- **Architecture & State Management:**
  - The server-side state sanitization layer ensures client stability.
  - The `game_phase` is managed reliably, creating a predictable state machine.
  - The technology stack is stable, with a simplified SQLite backend.

## What's Left to Build

- **Settings Screen:** A dedicated screen for application settings (e.g., sound, display options) in the Kivy app is designed in the workflow but not yet implemented.
- **Dicer Integration:** Future integration with the "Dicer" AI system is planned but not started.
- **Player Client for Score Updates:** Implement a separate, mobile-first web client designed specifically for players. This client will:
  - Allow a player to modify only their own Score and CP.
  - Feature a minimal UI without the splash or game over screens of the main spectator client.
  - Be accessible via player-specific QR codes generated on the Kivy app's Name Entry screen.
- **Performance Optimization:** While performance is currently acceptable, targeted optimization has not been a focus.

## Current Status

- **Overall:** The project is successfully deployed and stable on the target Raspberry Pi hardware. The core features are complete and the installation process is automated and reliable.
- **Focus:** The current focus is on completing this memory bank documentation update cycle before moving on to new feature development.

## Known Issues

- There are currently no known critical bugs. The application is in a known-good, working state on both macOS and Raspberry Pi.

## Blockers

- There are no active blockers.
