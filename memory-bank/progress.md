# Progress

## What Works

- Application launches successfully on both macOS and Raspberry Pi
- Game state loading and saving
- All game screens and transitions
- Timer functionality
- Score and CP tracking
- Touchscreen input on Raspberry Pi
- Auto-start via systemd service
- CLI boot with auto-login
- Database reset functionality is now fully tested and working with both SQLAlchemy and direct SQLite access.
- The test runner sets the DATABASE_URL environment variable to use SQLite, ensuring both the test and SQLAlchemy operate on the same database file.

## What's Left to Build

- Settings screen functionality
- Additional game features (if any)
- Performance optimizations (if needed)
- Database-backed game state management:
  - Local PostgreSQL database setup
  - WebSocket server for real-time updates
  - New API layer for game management
  - Web interface for remote score management
  - Data migration tools
- Consider adding more tests for edge cases.
- Update documentation and the Memory Bank as needed.
- Proceed with integration or deployment.

## Current Status

- Application is stable and ready for testing
- Core functionality is complete
- Both development and production environments are configured
- Planning phase for database implementation
- The database reset logic successfully clears all records from turns, players, and games.
- The test runner is configured to use SQLite for local testing.

## Known Issues

- Splash screen timing discrepancy:

  - Rushes by too quickly on Raspberry Pi
  - Displays correctly on macOS
  - Need to investigate platform-specific timing differences

- Game state management:

  - Multiple implementations of load_game_state() could lead to inconsistencies
  - Some error handling paths may not properly reset game state
  - Need to consolidate and standardize game state handling

- Screen transitions:

  - Some transitions use very short delays (0.1s) which may be too quick on Raspberry Pi
  - Could affect UI updates and timer resumptions
  - Need to test and potentially adjust timing for Raspberry Pi

- Timer synchronization:
  - Potential slight timing discrepancies when resuming games
  - Could affect game fairness in timed matches
  - Need to verify timer accuracy across platforms

## Blockers

- None at this time
